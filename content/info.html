			Formula Hybrid is an annual international collegiate event held at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Louden, NH each spring. The competition
			attracts top students from a long list of highly-reputable schools, many of which focus educational emphases on STEM research and development.
			To compete, student teams must design, manufacture, and build a highly complex, formula-style racecar consisting of a hybrid drivetrain.
		</p>
		<p class="indented">
			The student vehicles are then put through a rigorous set of inspection processes, design evaluations, and dynamic racing events in order to test
			the overall vehicle ability and engineering proficiency. The competition promotes creativity and design innovation to help drive technical
			educational development, culminating in what the Society of Automotive Engineers hails as “the most challenging of all the SAE Collegiate Design
			Series engineering competitions.”
		</p>
		
		<p class="indented">
			The 2019 Formula Hybrid competition will take place April 29 - May 2, 2019.
